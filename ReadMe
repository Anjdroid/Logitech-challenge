Hello!

We are the Triple Key and this is our project.
It was designed for the Logitech challenge at StartHack 2016 to be used with
their G810 keyboard.

Basically it is about people playing games on the keyboard while waiting for stuff 
like big (graphically demanding) games to load. 

It consist of a few simplistic games which are located in the \Triple key\Assets\Logitech SDK\Script Sample\ folder.

Thank you again for the opportunity and all the fun we had with the 
awesome keyboard.
